``weights_column``
------------------

- Available in: GBM, DRF, Deep Learning, GLM
- Hyperparameter: no

Description
~~~~~~~~~~~

This option specifies the column in a training frame to be used when determining weights. Weights are per-row observation weights and do not increase the size of the data frame. This is typically the number of times a row is repeated, but non-integer values are also supported. During training, rows with higher weights matter more, due to the larger loss function pre-factor.

For scoring, all computed metrics will take the observation weights into account (for Gains/Lift, AUC, confusion matrices, logloss, etc.), so itâ€™s important to also provide the weights column for validation or test sets if you want to up/down-weight certain observations (ideally consistently between training and testing). Note that if you omit the weights, then all observations will have equal weights (set to 1) for the computation of the metrics. For example, a weight of 2 is identical to duplicating a row. 

**Notes**: 

- Weights can be specified as integers or as non-integers.
- You do not have to specify a weight when calling ``model.predict()``. New test data will have the weights column with the same column name. 
- The weights column cannot be the same as the `fold_column <fold_column.html>`__.
